## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few personal LLM workflow and agentic projects to help me work more efficiently and test out the pmf of vertical SaaS products
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on vertical AI projects in investment management and investment banking use cases
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm the proud mom of a sourdough starter that's now 4 years old! I bake regularly and are always on the look for ways to improve and iterate over my existing recipes. Baking is optimizing over an infinite and continuous parameter space!
